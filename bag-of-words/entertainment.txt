A: Did you see "Titanic"?
B: Yes. It is a great movie.
A: I saw it twelve times.
B: I saw it eight times.
A: I have the DVD.
B: So do I.
A: Let's go to your home.
B: We can watch my DVD.
A: And then we can go to my home.
B: And watch your DVD.
A: I always cry at the end.
B: Me too. It's so sad.
A: Let's play cards.
B: I don't know any card games.
A: I'll teach you one.
B: Okay. What will you teach me?
A: It's called poker.
B: Is it easy to learn?
A: Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
B: Okay. Teach me how to play.
A: We each get five cards.
B: Oh, look. I have four tens.
A: That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
B: Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.
A: I'm a good card player.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I watch the other players.
B: What do you mean?
A: People will tell you if they have a good hand.
B: How do they do that?
A: For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
B: When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
A: I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
B: He never wins your money?
A: Nope, and it drives him crazy.
B: He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.
A: Turn the radio down, please.
B: But I'm listening to it.
A: Well, listen to it more quietly.
B: I can't wait till I grow up.
A: What will you do?
B: I will play the radio as loud as I want.
A: That's okay with me.
B: I will have a radio in every room of my house.
A: Remind me to never visit you.
B: All the radios will be on extra loud.
A: Your neighbors will hate you.
B: If they don't like it, they can move.
A: I hope I win the lotto.
B: Your chances are very small.
A: But you can't win if you don't play.
B: Ha! You can't win if you do play.
A: Someone has to win.
B: That's what everyone says.
A: It might as well be me.
B: That's what everyone says.
A: You're trying to tell me something.
B: That didn't take long.
A: You think I should quit playing.
B: Save your money for school.
A: What's on TV?
B: Nothing much.
A: What about the baseball game?
B: It got rained out.
A: Rained out?
B: Yes, rained out.
A: How could that be?
B: Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
A: I thought they were playing under a dome.
B: The dome doesn't close.
A: Why doesn't it close?
B: Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.
A: Can I try your coffee?
B: Sure. Here you go.
A: Hmm, that's not bad.
B: There's nothing in it.
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, it's just coffee.
A: I figured that.
B: It's not too bitter for you?
A: It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
B: There's no sugar or cream in it.
A: No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
B: Sort of like beer.
A: Let's take a walk.
B: What's the weather like?
A: Let me step outside and see.
B: It's a little chilly, right?
A: Yes, it is.
B: I'll put on my cap.
A: Wear a jacket, too.
B: I wonder if I should bring my gloves.
A: Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
B: I'll put a glove in each pocket.
A: We'll get warmer as we walk.
B: Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down.
A: Look at the car chase on TV!
B: That driver is crazy.
A: I can't believe he hasn't crashed.
B: How fast is he going?
A: They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
B: He's going to kill someone.
A: Look! He just hit that car.
B: Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.
A: Now he's slowing down.
B: Maybe he ran out of gas.
A: Look! He just got out of the car and started running.
B: I hope the police catch him.
A: TV news is so stupid.
B: They shouldn't even call it news.
A: Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
B: Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
A: Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
B: Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
A: The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
B: The sports guy shows us players fighting.
A: They always tell us "what's next."
B: They always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.
A: It's more like news for kids.
B: They should have kid reporters.
A: I love my computer.
B: Computers are so cool.
A: I love to go online.
B: The Internet is amazing.
A: You can travel all over the world.
B: I know. I went to China yesterday.
A: What did you do?
B: I stood on the Great Wall and looked all around.
A: What was it like?
B: It was like the real thing.
A: It was like being there?
B: Yes, I felt like I was actually there.
A: The Beatles are the best.
B: They are the best musical group ever.
A: I love all their songs.
B: I don't know which one I like the best.
A: I like the ones I can sing along with.
B: So do I, like "She Loves You."
A: "She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!..."
B: "…And you know you should be glad!"
A: What a great song.
B: How about "Let It Be?"
A: Oh, yes! "Let it be, let it be…"
B: "…There will be an answer, let it be!"
A: Let's go to a movie.
B: I'd rather not.
A: Why not?
B: You know I don't like crowds.
A: Let's go to an early movie.
B: Okay, that won't be very crowded.
A: What would you like to see?
B: Oh, I don't care. You're the one who wants to go out.
A: Well, I want to see "The Pursuit of Happyness."
B: What have you heard about it?
A: It's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
B: Well, I hope it has a happy ending.
A: What's your favorite thing to do?
B: I like to watch people.
A: That's your favorite thing to do?
B: Well, it's one of them.
A: Where do you go to watch people?
B: My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.
A: That sounds like a good spot.
B: We watch people walk by with their dogs.
A: I guess you see lots of different dogs.
B: We don't even know what kind most of them are.
A: There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
B: Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.
A: They call him Father Dollar Bill.
B: Yes, he was on the TV news today.
A: Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.
B: Is it his money?
A: No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
B: How much money does he give away?
A: This year he gave away $15,000.
B: That's a lot of money.
A: He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
B: What about the other homeless people?
A: They got $1 each.
B: People stood in line just to get one dollar?!
A: Old movies are the best.
B: Even though they're in black and white.
A: A good story is more important than color.
B: Actors didn't curse back then.
A: And there was no violence.
B: People today don't like that.
A: No, today people like lots of action.
B: I like a good story.
A: I like to see actors who are like real people.
B: Like real people with real problems.
A: They still make movies like that.
B: Yes, but they never make much money.
A: Do you get PBS on TV?
B: Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.
A: It puts me to sleep.
B: Tell me about it.
A: A gardening show follows a knitting show.
B: A cooking show follows a sewing show.
A: A travel show follows another travel show.
B: I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!
A: Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
B: I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
A: If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.
B: Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.
A: I love to watch "Judge Judy."
B: Is that a TV show?
A: Yes. It's on every afternoon.
B: What's so good about it?
A: They have interesting lawsuits.
B: Such as?
A: Yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on eBay.
B: Was something wrong with the phone?
A: It works only in Canada.
B: Did the seller know that?
A: Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.
B: I hope Judge Judy made the seller take the phone back.
A: That woman is a very good singer.
B: Yes, but she looks like a man.
A: What difference does it make?
B: Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
A: Singers are supposed to sound good.
B: They should look good, too.
A: There are lots of ugly men singers.
B: Men singers don't have to look good.
A: Then neither do women singers.
B: Well, I would never buy her CD.
A: But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?
B: Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.
A: All the TV stations are going to go digital.
B: Yes, that will occur next month.
A: Most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
B: The digital signal is very clear.
A: Oh, no, it isn't!
B: What do you mean?
A: I can't get a single channel.
B: Do you have a digital TV?
A: Of course. But I don't have cable.
B: You don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.
A: But I have rabbit ears.
B: Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.
