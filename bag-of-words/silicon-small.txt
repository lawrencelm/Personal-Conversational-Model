\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 THOMAS: Fuck, I\'92m going to have to go to graduate school. I can\'92t afford to stay here even if I\'92m working full time at Boodle. Thomas looks down at the TV where Gavin Belson is still talking. \
GAVIN: That is how Boodle can change the world. \
THOMAS: Changing the world, one crappy app at a time.\
LAURIE: Have a seat. There aren't any. \
RICHARD: sits Indian-style on the floor and peers up clumsily over the desk. \
LAURIE: At Raviga Capital, we pride ourselves on being "founder friendly."\
RICHARD: You fired me on Snapchat.\
LAURIE: That respect is critical to our deal flow. We know entrepreneurs have plenty of suitors on Sand Hill. RICHARD: You didn't even write anything. Richard holds up his phone. Her snap is just ! -- the fire emoji -- huge. \
LAURIE: It's disrespectful to screenshot snaps. \
RICHARD: It was hard with your one second timer. \
LAURIE: I'm setting up interviews for your replacement and we'd like you to participate. This is a small town; the board wants everyone to know you're on board with the board. \
RICHARD: There's no way I'm gonna help you hire someone else. \
LAURIE: Well if you don't, Pied Piper might experience a little "compression" of its own. 3. \
RICHARD: What? \
LAURIE: Just a little wordplay. No, it means we'll fire you. Richard holds up his phone ("you already did that"). \
LAURIE: We're "managing you out" of the CEO role, not Pied Piper itself. No one knows more about the tech than you do. \
RICHARD: So...you're looking for a CEO with a little less experience? \
LAURIE: We're looking for a CEO, period. RICHARD (flustered) I'm already...this company was... LAURIE And there's the problem, isn't it. A leader campaigns in poetry and governs in prose. You sound like Siri having a stroke. \
RICHARD: I wrote almost every line of code in Pied Piper. Every function, every class, every library. LAURIE And you're a gifted coder, no question. But a leader has command. A leader has presence. You're smart beyond compare, Richard. But you are not a CEO. Laurie walks out. \
RICHARD: (convincing himself) I have presence. A beat. And then the automatic office lights turn off, unaware our hapless hero is still down on the floor. The pitch blackness gives way to... 4.\
DINESH: Isn't it weird how fun it sounds to get laid off? Like, everyone wants to get laid. And everyone wants to get off. But nobody wants to get laid off. \
GILFOYLE: I wouldn't mind your mom's pink slip. \
DINESH: Well, your ex did put you on a performance improvement plan. \
ERLICH: This is so fucked. His name's on the door and they shat all over him anyway, just to hire some suit. It's like firing Captain Crunch. (roleplaying) Hey kids, sorry I didn't have time to get my MBA while I was pioneering the entire field of maritime breakfast. You'll just have to bend over for Admiral Wharton's plank instead. \
GILFOYLE: Are you saying that Captain Crunch was on a career path to pedophilia? \
ERLICH: I'm saying he deserved a chance to find out. \
DINESH: I don't even understand how this is possible. Richard is the firer, not the firee. He's the boss. \
JARED: Actually, it's a common misconception that the CEO is the final authority. She serves at the pleasure of the shareholders. }
