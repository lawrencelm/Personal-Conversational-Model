A: I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 17.

B: We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you?
A: It depends on the price, of course. What is it?
B: It's $308 a night.
A: I have no problem with that.
B: Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?

A: A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit the spot.
B: I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?
A: Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!
B: Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? 
A: Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. 
B: That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all charged to your amenities account.
A: Not a problem.
