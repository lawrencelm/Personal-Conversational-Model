A: I've got a date for you.
B: Oh, really?
A: Are you interested?
B: Maybe. What is she like?
A: She's got a great personality.
B: Uh-oh. That means that she's fat and ugly.
A: She's cute.
B: Okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
A: She weighs 98 pounds.
B: Okay, she's not fat. So what's the problem with her?
A: Who said there is a problem with her?
B: The problem is she has no problems—she's too good for me!
A: I think you're very pretty.
B: Thank you.
A: Would you have dinner with me?
B: I would like to.
A: Can I pick you up Friday night?
B: What time?
A: Eight o'clock.
B: That sounds great.
A: We'll go to a French restaurant.
B: I've never been to a French restaurant.
A: I think you'll love the food.
B: I'm not going to eat any snails!
A: You have pretty eyes.
B: Thank you. So do you.
A: I wish my eyes were blue.
B: What's the matter with green eyes?
A: Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
B: Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
A: But what if I'm a fish in my next life?
B: I think some fish have blue eyes.
A: I hope I don't come back as a fish.
B: I hope I come back as a cat.
A: Cats have beautiful eyes.
B: I would love to have blue cat-eyes.
A: I love you.
B: I love you, too.
A: I loved you the first day I saw you.
B: It was love at first sight?
A: Yes, it was love at first sight.
B: I didn't love you at first.
A: I know. I had to chase you for a while.
B: Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.
A: Now you're mine forever.
B: And you're mine forever.
A: We'll grow old together.
B: And be happy together.
A: I'm in love with that girl.
B: Have you told her?
A: Of course not.
B: Why not?
A: She would laugh at me.
B: How do you know?
A: Because they always do.
B: Maybe she's different.
A: They're all the same.
B: Just ask her out to dinner.
A: And then what?
B: And then she'll know that you like her.
A: Give me a hug.
B: I'm not in the mood.
A: What's the matter?
B: I saw you looking at that woman.
A: What woman?
B: You know, that woman with the big boobs.
A: I was not looking at her.
B: You were, too.
A: I'm not interested in her.
B: Then why were you looking at her?
A: I was looking at something else.
B: Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.
A: Would you like to go on a blind date?
B: You must be joking.
A: No, I'm serious.
B: I don't want to date a blind woman.
A: A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
B: What does it mean?
A: A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
B: Why would I date someone I don't even know?
A: To try something new and exciting.
B: What if I don't like her?
A: Then you don't date her again.
A: I have a date tomorrow night.
B: Really? Who with?
A: A girl I met at the market.
B: You met a girl at the supermarket?
A: She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
B: What did you say to her?
A: I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.
B: She asked you about your pineapples?
A: I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.
B: That was nice of you.
A: She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.
B: Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.
A: Did you have a date Friday night?
B: Yes, in fact, I did.
A: Who did you go out with?
B: A man I met in a coffee shop.
A: Where did you go?
B: We went to a nice restaurant.
A: Anywhere else?
B: Then we went to a jazz club.
A: That sounds like a nice date.
B: Yes, it was pleasant.
A: But you won't date him again?
B: No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.
A: I had the worst date the other night.
B: What happened?
A: First of all, he was half an hour late.
B: That's not a good start.
A: Then he didn't bother to apologize.
B: That's rude.
A: Then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
B: That's dangerous.
A: I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
B: What happened at the restaurant?
A: We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
B: I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.
A: I don't like that man.
B: Why not?
A: He's a dirty old man.
B: What do you mean?
A: He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
B: Well, you can't blame a man for asking.
A: He should act his age.
B: But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
A: They should find a nice hobby.
B: Just wait until you're 50 years old.
A: Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
B: That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.
A: Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
B: Sometimes.
A: What does she do?
B: Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.
A: That was a nice thing to say.
B: That's what I thought.
A: What did she say?
B: She laughed! She didn't believe me.
A: That wasn't very nice of her.
B: She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
A: What did you say?
B: I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.
A: Some people have good noses.
B: I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.
A: I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.
B: Oh. But that can be a curse.
A: Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
B: I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
A: Did she catch you using drugs?
B: Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
A: You don't need a good nose for that—cigarettes stink.
B: But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
A: Boy, that is a good nose.
B: I told her she should apply for a job at customs.
