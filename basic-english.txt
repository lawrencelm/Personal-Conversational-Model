B: Yes, I do.
A: What kind of car do you have?

A: Is it new?
B: It was new in 2003.
A: So, it's pretty old now.
B: Yes, it is. But it still looks good.
A: Do you take good care of it?
B: Oh, yes. I wash it once a week.
A: Do you change the oil?
B: My mechanic changes the oil twice a year.
A: Do you have a girlfriend?
B: No, I don't. Do you?
A: I don't have a girlfriend, either.
B: Why not?
A: I don't know. Maybe I'm not rich enough.
B: Girls like guys with money.
A: They sure do.
B: They like guys with new cars.
A: I don't have money or a new car.
B: Me, neither.
A: But girls like guys who are funny.
B: Maybe we should learn some good jokes.
A: Where are you going?
B: I have to walk the dog.
A: What kind of dog do you have?
B: I have a little poodle.
A: Poodles bark a lot.
B: They sure do.
A: They bark at everything.
B: They never shut up.
A: Why did you get a poodle?
B: It's my mom's dog.
A: So she likes poodles.
B: She says they're good watchdogs.
A: Can I borrow $5?
B: Sure. Why do you need it?
A: I want to buy lunch.
B: Where's your money?
A: It's not in my wallet.
B: Your wallet is empty?
A: I don't have even one dollar in it.
B: Being broke is no fun.
A: Even if it's only for a short while.
B: It's always good to have friends.
A: Friends will lend you money when you're broke.
B: As long as you pay them back.
A: Let's go to the beach.
B: That's a great idea.
A: We haven't been in a while.
B: We haven't been in a month.
A: The last time we went, you almost drowned.
B: No, I didn't.
A: Then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
B: I think he wanted to cool off.
A: He swam right up to you.
B: And then he turned right around.
A: Maybe you're right.
B: Maybe we should get going.
A: Are you married?
B: No. I'm divorced.
A: When did you get divorced?
B: I got divorced two years ago.
A: Why did you get divorced?
B: My wife left me.
A: Why did she leave you?
B: She said she didn't love me anymore.
A: Wow! That's terrible.
B: Yes, it was.
A: Why didn't she love you anymore?
B: She fell in love with my best friend.
A: I'm bored.
B: What's on TV?
A: Nothing.
B: There must be something on TV!
A: Nothing that's interesting.
B: What about that new game show?
A: Which one?
B: "Deal or No Deal"
A: Tell me you're joking.
B: I love that show.
A: I watched it once. That was enough.
B: It's on right now. Let's watch it together.
A: I like living here.
B: I agree. Pasadena is a nice city.
A: It's not too big.
B: And it's not too small.
A: It has great weather all year long.
B: It has the Rose Parade.
A: It has beautiful houses.
B: It has wonderful restaurants.
A: It has great schools.
B: It's close to the mountains.
A: The people are friendly.
B: I'm not ever going to leave.
A: We need a new mattress.
B: What's the matter with this one?
A: It's not comfortable.
B: It seems fine to me.
A: I toss and turn all night.
B: You should stop drinking coffee.
A: Look at these marks on my arms.
B: What are they?
A: They are bites.
B: Did the cat bite you?
A: No. The bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
B: Okay. Let's get a new mattress.
A: My laptop is so slow.
B: Buy a new one.
A: I would if I had the money.
B: Why is it so slow?
A: That's a good question.
B: Did you take it to a computer shop?
A: I would if I had the money.
B: Well, I guess you have to live with it.
A: Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.
B: You don't want to do that.
A: Why not?
B: You might hit someone in the head.
A: What's for dinner?
B: I'm not sure.
A: How about a pizza?
B: You had pizza for lunch.
A: But I love pizza.
B: Everybody loves pizza.
A: So why can't I have pizza for dinner?
B: Because you need variety.
A: What's "variety?
B: Different thingsâ€”not the same thing all the time.
A: You mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?
B: No, I mean a salad instead of a pizza.
A: We need to save money.
B: Why do we need to save money?
A: Because we need to buy a house.
B: But a house is so expensive.
A: That's why we need to save money.
B: How much do we need to save?
A: We need to save enough for a down payment.
B: How much is that?
A: That's about $30,000.
B: Thirty thousand dollars! That will take forever.
A: Not if we save every penny.
B: Okay. Here's seven pennies.
A: The ocean is so big.
B: You can't see the end of it.
A: It goes on and on forever.
B: And it's deep, too.
A: I think it's five miles deep.
B: Are there fish at the bottom?
A: There are fish at the top and the bottom.
B: Are there more fish or more people?
A: I think there are more fish.
B: I hope so. I love to eat fish.
A: I'm upset with my mom.
B: Why is that?
A: I warned her about her new boyfriend. She didn't listen to me.
B: What happened?
A: I gave her $1,000 for her birthday. I told her to spend it on herself.
B: That was very nice of you.
A: I found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
B: Why did she do that?
A: He said he would buy her a nice ring.
B: What's wrong with that?
A: He went to Las Vegas. He lost it all gambling.
B: I hope your mom broke up with him.
A: Do animals talk to each other?
B: Of course they talk to each other.
A: What do they talk about?
B: They talk about other animals.
A: What else do they talk about?
B: They talk about food and the weather.
A: Do they talk about us?
B: Of course they talk about us.
A: What do they say about us?
B: They say that we are funny-looking.
A: Ha! We're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
B: We're funny-looking because we wear clothes.
A: I have to clean the house.
B: Yes, it's very dirty.
A: You can help me.
B: Why me?
A: Because you helped make it dirty.
B: What do you want me to do?
A: I want you to clean the bathroom.
B: Oh, that's easy.
A: Clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.
B: That's a lot of work.
A: Tell me when you finish.
B: I don't think so. You'll just give me more work.
A: You're watching too much TV.
B: What do you mean?
A: I mean you're wasting your life.
B: I'm having fun.
A: You're sitting there with your mouth open.
B: Who cares?
A: I care. Do something.
B: Okay. I did something.
A: What did you do?
B: I turned up the volume.
A: That's not what I meant by "do something."
B: Will you do something? Leave me alone.
A: Did you write a letter to grandma?
B: Yes, I did.
A: Did you tell her about school?
B: I told her that school is fun.
A: Did you put the letter in an envelope?
B: Yes, and I sealed the envelope.
A: Did you put a stamp on the envelope?
B: I couldn't find any stamps.
A: They're in the kitchen drawer.
B: Okay. I just put a stamp on the envelope.
A: Give me the envelope, and I'll mail it for you.
B: When is grandma going to learn about e-mail?
A: Why are you yawning?
B: I'm sleepy.
A: Why don't you go to bed?
B: I want to watch this TV show.
A: Maybe you should record it.
B: The tape recorder is broken.
A: Then you should watch the rerun.
B: Why? I'm watching the original.
A: But you'll be asleep in about one minute.
B: I'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
A: Okay. I'll tell you how the show ends.
B: Zzz.
A: It's Sunday.
B: So?
A: You know what that means.
B: I forgot.
A: Sunday means we go to church.
B: Oh, yeah.
A: Put on a coat and tie.
B: Why?
A: To show respect to God and others.
B: I'm glad Sunday is only once a week.
A: I hope God didn't hear that.
B: He'll forgive me.
A: Did you feed the cat?
B: I'll do that in a minute.
A: The cat is meowing. He's hungry.
B: Okay. I'll feed him right now.
A: You shouldn't make him wait.
B: I was doing my homework.
A: The cat doesn't care about your homework.
B: The cat doesn't care about anything.
A: That's the way cats are.
B: All they think about is themselves.
A: Maybe we should get rid of him.
B: Of course not! He's family.
A: I hate shaving.
B: Me too.
A: I just cut myself again.
B: Did you use a new blade?
A: It doesn't matter. Old blades cut, new blades cut.
B: Maybe you should use an electric shaver.
A: They make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
B: Maybe you should stop shaving.
A: And grow a beard?
B: Sure. Why not?
A: Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
B: Hmm. Here's an idea. Put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
A: Excuse me.
B: Yes?
A: Are you reading this paper?
B: Oh, no. Help yourself.
A: I asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
B: Thank you. That's polite of you to ask.
A: Some people would just pick it up.
B: Yes, I know. Some people are rude.
A: I always try to be polite.
B: So do I.
A: The world needs more polite people like us.
B: I agree 100 percent.
A: Mom, I want a puppy.
B: Let me think about it.
A: Why do you have to think about it?
B: Because a puppy costs money.
A: No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.
B: Yes, but a puppy needs shots.
A: Shots for what?
B: So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.
A: I hate shots.
B: And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.
A: No problem. I'll give him food off my plate.
B: Oh, no you don't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.
A: Look at all these kittens!
B: How many are there?
A: Eight.
B: They're all so cute.
A: Yes, but I can't keep them.
B: What are you going to do with them?
A: I'm going to give them away. Do you want one?
B: Yes, I would love one.
A: Which one do you want?
B: That one. The one that's all black.
A: Yes, I like that one, too.
B: I'll call him Blacky.
A: My parents go to church every Sunday.
B: They trust in God.
A: They hope they will go to heaven.
B: They probably will.
A: But no one knows for sure.
B: That's for sure.
A: No one knows what happens after we die.
B: If we are good, we will be happy in heaven with God.
A: That's what many people believe.
B: If we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.
A: I don't want to go to hell.
B: Let's go to church with your parents on Sunday.
A: My husband died.
B: I'm sorry for you.
A: Thank you.
B: When did he die?
A: A couple of months ago.
B: You still miss him.
A: Yes, but I talk to him almost every day.
B: When you go to church?
A: No, when I call him on his cell phone.
B: What do you mean?
A: I buried him with his cell phone.
B: What will you do when the battery dies?
A: Today is Friday the thirteenth.
B: That's a bad day.
A: It's supposed to be unlucky.
B: You're supposed to stay home all day.
A: That's what I do.
B: My friend stayed in a hotel on Friday the thirteenth.
A: That was a mistake.
B: He stayed on the thirteenth floor.
A: What happened?
B: Someone stole his laptop.
A: He was asking for it.
B: He learned his lesson. He's home today.
A: Do you really love me?
B: Of course.
A: Prove it.
B: How can I prove it?
A: Take me to dinner.
B: That's it? That's all I have to do?
A: Take me to a nice restaurant, not to McDonald's.
B: But a nice restaurant costs money.
A: Yes, and you have to make a reservation.
B: That's such a hassle.
A: I knew you didn't love me.
B: Okay, okay! I'll make a reservation right now.
A: My parents are divorced.
B: So are mine.
A: Why did your parents get divorced?
B: My father found a new girlfriend.
A: That's too bad.
B: My mother was hurt and angry.
A: She had good reason. What did she do?
B: She told him to drop his girlfriend.
A: What did your father do?
B: He moved out of our house.
A: I guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
B: Yes, but she left him a year later.
A: My grandma's apartment smells funny.
B: So does mine.
A: I think it's an old people's smell.
B: Really?
A: Yes. I think when you get old, you begin to smell.
B: Like fruit that is too ripe?
A: Yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
B: But the smell is different.
A: Yes, old people don't smell like fruit.
B: No, they smell like a thrift shop.
A: Yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.
B: Yes, an old smell.
A: The price of stamps goes up and up.
B: I think stamps used to cost a penny.
A: That was a long time ago.
B: It was before I was born.
A: Now a stamp is 42 cents.
B: But in May it will be 44 cents.
A: Have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
B: No, I haven't.
A: Neither have I.
B: So, they do a good job for the money.
A: Yes, they do.
B: Maybe we shouldn't complain.
A: A button came off my shirt.
B: What are you going to do?
A: First, I have to find the button.
B: Where did you lose it?
A: I have no idea.
B: A button is hard to find. Did you look in your pant cuffs?
A: That's a good idea.
B: I found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
A: Let me look. No, it's not there.
B: Many shirts come with an extra button.
A: You're right. This one does have an extra button.
B: Now all you have to do is sew it on.
A: I have to go to the bathroom.
B: You drink too much coffee.
A: But I love coffee.
B: Well, it's your life.
A: You eat too much chocolate.
B: I don't think so.
A: Have you looked in the mirror?
B: Do you think I'm getting fat?
A: I didn't say that.
B: What did you say?
A: I said I have to go to the bathroom.
B: That's what I thought you said.
A: Did you do the laundry?
B: Yes, I did.
A: What did you wash?
B: I washed the sheets and towels.
A: What about the pillowcases?
B: Yes, I took them off the pillows and washed them.
A: Did you dry everything in the dryer?
B: Yes, I dried everything in the dryer.
A: Then what did you do?
B: I folded all the towels.
A: Did you put the sheets on the beds?
B: Yes, and I put the pillowcases on the pillows.
A: Do you listen to the radio?
B: I listen day and night.
A: What do you listen to?
B: Mostly talk radio.
A: What's that?
B: People talk about current events.
A: What do they say?
B: They say they want change.
A: What kind of change?
B: They want tax cuts.
A: Why do they want tax cuts?
B: Because tax cuts will save them money.
A: Mom, I'm hungry.
B: Look in the fridge.
A: I'm looking. There's nothing to eat.
B: Are you sure?
A: It's almost empty.
B: I went to the market yesterday.
A: I don't see anything.
B: I bought lots of oranges and apples.
A: I don't want fruit. I want something tasty.
B: Eat the fruit. It's good for you.
A: Next time you go to the market, let me go with you.
B: No, thank you. All you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.
A: What is there to eat?
B: I don't know. Look in the fridge.
A: I think I'll make a sandwich.
B: What kind?
A: A ham sandwich.
B: The bread is in the cabinet.
A: Where's the mustard?
B: It's in the fridge, I think.
A: Oh, yes, here it is. Do you want a sandwich?
B: Yes, that sounds nice.
A: How about some potato chips?
B: Yes. And a pickle, if we have any.
A: It's time for your bath, young lady.
B: But, Mom, I'm not dirty.
A: You need a bath every day.
B: Why?
A: Because you don't want to smell bad.
B: I don't smell bad.
A: That's what you think.
B: If I smelled bad, I could smell me.
A: I can smell you.
B: I can smell you, too.
A: That's my perfume.
B: When can I wear perfume?
A: Something's wrong with my computer.
B: Exactly what?
A: All I get is a black screen.
B: What's the matter?
A: I think I know, because this happened before.
B: What happened before?
A: My hard drive crashed.
B: Oh, no. That's bad news.
A: It sure is, but I'm going to call HP first, just to make sure.
B: Will you lose all your files?
A: No, I always back up my files.
B: You're smart.
A: I called HP about my computer.
B: What did they say?
A: They said I need a new hard drive.
B: That's too bad. How much is a new one?
A: It's not too much, only about $85.
B: Plus installation?
A: No, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.
B: Really?
A: Yes, it's just a couple of screws.
B: That's nice.
A: It's a lot better than paying someone $60.
B: If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.
A: What's your email address?
B: It's bluedog123.
A: Bluedog123. Are you sure that's all?
B: Yes.
A: No. That's incomplete.
B: What do you mean?
A: What's your mailing address?
B: 456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, CA 91170.
A: That's correct.
B: So what's the problem?
A: Bluedog123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP code.
B: Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com.
A: I'm going to take a nap.
B: You should unplug the phone.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Do you want me to wake you in an hour?
A: No, thanks. Just let me sleep until I wake up.
B: I'll start dinner at 6:00.
A: Okay. I think I'll be awake by then.
B: If not, your nose will wake you up.
A: You mean I will smell the food cooking?
B: You might even dream about dinner.
A: I don't think I'm going to dream about anything. I'm really tired.
B: Have a nice nap.
A: That was a nice funeral.
B: Yes, dad, it was.
A: The son gave a nice speech about his father.
B: It was long, too.
A: I think it was about 45 minutes long.
B: But it went by fast. It was interesting.
A: I liked it.
B: I'll give you a speech like that, too.
A: Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
B: Of course.
A: I think only the family will be there.
B: You have lots of friends. They will be there, too!
A: Yikes! What was that noise?
B: I had to blow my nose.
A: Did you have to blow right next to the phone?
B: Did you hear that?
A: Of course I heard that. I thought a plane had crashed into your house.
B: It wasn't that loud.
A: I will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.
B: Okay. I'll take your word for it.
A: I thought you had an elephant in your house.
B: You're funny.
A: What did you say? I think I've gone deaf.
B: I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. I'll be right back.
A: I have lots of friends.
B: Really? How many do you have?
A: I don't know, maybe one hundred.
B: That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend?
A: Of course. I have lots of best friends.
B: How many best friends do you have?
A: I think about twenty-five.
B: Hmm. I have only one best friend.
A: I feel sorry for you.
B: I have only a few friends.
A: You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.
B: That's very nice of you.
A: Don't you ever cheat on me.
B: Why would I do that?
A: Because men like to cheat.
B: Some men do, but not me.
A: I'm watching you.
B: I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.
A: If I catch you, you'll be sorry.
B: You won't catch me, because I love you. I'm not a cheater.
A: I will poke your eyes out. 
B: I don't want any other woman.
A: I will chop your toes off, one by one.
B: Honey, please. You're the only woman for me, forever. I swear it.
A: I hate to go outside.
B: Me too.
A: Why do you hate to go outside?
B: I meet too many jerks.
A: I agree.
B: This city is full of jerks.
A: Rude people are everywhere.
B: But what can you do?
A: You can yell at them.
B: And they will yell back at you.
A: Yelling doesn't do any good.
B: No. The best thing to do is just stay home.
A: Will you look at this form?
B: Are you having problems with it?
A: I don't understand some things.
B: Let me help you.
A: What does "MI" mean?
B: "MI" stands for Middle Initial.
A: What does "MM/DD/YY" mean?
B: That means Month/Day/Year. Use numbers.
A: I don't understand.
B: For example, if your birth date is January 12, 1987, write 01/12/87.
A: Oh. That's simple enough.
B: Always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.
